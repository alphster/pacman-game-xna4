PACMAN TODO
- Review pacman dossier overall for more exact behaviors
- Add pacman "slowdown" by a percent when he eats something (from dossier)
- add start and options
- add levels, find out what level increases do
- tweak scatter/chase/etc times according to the dossier
- make sure you are unloading content when pacman dies... ghosts need to be unloaded
